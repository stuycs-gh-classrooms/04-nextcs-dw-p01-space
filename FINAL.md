### Changes
What changed about your game after the design phase? Separate changes that occured after the feedback round and changes that occured during programming.

After feedback: I reordered the structure of some of my functions and classes (ex. made bullets a new class instead of a sub-category of ships)
During Programming: I figured that adding background designs would be really cool so I added them as well as the color signifying what type of movement the enemy is doing to give a warning to the player. Unfortunately powerups were left of the cutting room floor due to time.
